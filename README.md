# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree
This repository includes my submissions of the projects in the nanodegree program [AI Programming with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

The first project involves utilizing a pre-trained image classifier to identify various dog breeds. Rather than developing or training the model from scratch, the primary objective was to showcase essential Python skills required for structuring a machine learning project. This included handling and preprocessing data, analyzing performance metrics, evaluating results, and comparing the efficiency and runtime of different classification models.

## Own Image Classifier
The second project focused on developing an image classifier with minimal starter code, requiring a near end-to-end implementation. Beginning with raw data, I handled data loading and transformation, selected an appropriate pre-trained network architecture, and built a custom classifier on top of it. I then trained and evaluated the neural network, implemented functionality to save and load model checkpoints, and visualized the model's predictions alongside their associated probabilities to interpret the results effectively.
